# CGR of Mathematical Sequences
Code to create CGRs of mathematical sequences.

## Functions
* `CGR_10sides(sequence)`: Creates a 10-gon CGR based on sequence of integers (array)
* `CGR_4sides(sequence, vertex names)`: Creates a 4-gon (square) CGR based on sequence of integers (array). Also takes another array that corresponds to the vertices of the square CGR.
* `Fibonacci(n)`: Creates an array populated with the Fibonacci sequence
* `Fibonaci_mod10(n)`: Creates an array populated with the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10
* `creatingPiArray(n)`: Creates an array populated with the digits of pi
* `dividingrate(n)`: Calculates the dividing ratio based on the number of vertices in the n-gon. Formula is from [Almeida and Vinga (2009)](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-100)
