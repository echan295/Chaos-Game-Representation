# Generalized Chaos Game Representation (CGR)
This folder gives you the code for producing CGR of n-gon for various values of n, with the option of changing the dividing rate.

## Function
* `cgr_generalized(N, b, r, filename)`: Plots CGR according to number of points `N`, n-gon vertices `v`, dividing rate `r`, with the option to save the figure under `filename`

## Script
*  `cgr_script.m`: Gives you examples of how to use `cgr_generalized()` function, and reproduces some results from the paper.
