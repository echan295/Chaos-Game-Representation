# CGR for Amino Acid Sequences (Polypeptides)
This folder gives you code to create CGRs for polypeptides.

## Functions
* `readseq(filename)`: Maps amino acid to corresponding integer. Outputs vector of integers (that corresponds to the polypeptide).
* `dividingrate(n)`: Calculates the dividing ratio based on the number of vertices in the n-gon. Formula is from [Almeida and Vinga (2009)](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-100)

## Scripts
* `aminoacid.m`: Script that gives several examples of CGR of polypeptides
